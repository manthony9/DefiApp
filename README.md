# DefiApp

##Description  
This is a simple dummy Decenteralized Finance App that uses Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js and Truffle. 
It mimics a situation where a potential investor with MDAI wants to mine some DAPP tokens. 
The investor puts their stake, gets the DAPP tokens and can also withdraw their stake and collecting their reward.
It uses Metamask and Ganache for testing.
